taintedphoenix: hello world!
test_01: hello?
test_01: it works so far

test_01: only one error

taintedphoenix: does it work?

taintedphoenix: i think so?

taintedphoenix: YES

taintedphoenix: IT WORKS

taintedphoenix: at least with one client...

taintedphoenix: i might try speeding up the interval for message detection

taintedphoenix: 1 second is actually very slow

test_01: ok so bad news is it doesnt work with two clients

test_01: but the good news is that that bug is a replit problem

test_01: and i have a few ideas for how it could be fixed

test_01: but i'll procrastinate on that for now

taintedphoenix: ok im gonna see what the minimum message update delaty time is

taintedphoenix: ok lets see if that worked

taintedphoenix: seems it did

taintedphoenix: that is much better

antony: it does

antony: for sure

antony: i dont want to go lower out of fear of breaking something lol

antony: ok now the only big thing left on my to do list is making this program work with multiple clients at the same time

test_01: nope

test_01: doesnt work

taintedphoenix: it works on windows

taintedphoenix: but replit-

taintedphoenix: nah

taintedphoenix: \nXD\n

test: message
