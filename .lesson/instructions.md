# Project 2
### A Final Demonstration of Knowledge

### Objective:
To write a program with all of your current programming skills and perhaps beyond, that you find interesting and entertaining.

### Assignment:
You are challenged with writing a program of your choice that includes many if not all of the topics we have learned and practiced in class.  These include different variable types, math operations, conditional statements, loops, functions, string operations, and lists. 

### Ideas to get you thinking:

* Create a to do list that prioritizes them for you
* Crossword Puzzle Word Finder
* Grade Tracker / Homework Schedule
* Boggle Game
* A score keeper for the game Scrabble
* Hangman (Here as an idea, but NOT allowed for submission)
* An updated redo of your Adventure Game using your new programming skills
* Advanced Turtle Drawing using all techniques

Make sure you check out the rubric to see how you will be assessed on this project.

### Notes:
* This is to be your final project and we expect all work submitted to be your own. 
* No sharing with fellow Python students.  
* We know how to search the internet too. 
* Consider file reading for more advanced programs that will allow you to save and load information
